# 🎮 HackStreetboys Game Simulator

A **Python-based game simulator** for running automated matches between different team strategies. This project is built upon the game engine provided by **WnCC IIT Bombay**, which we've modified to run without graphics and added parallel match simulation capabilities for efficient strategy testing.

- **Headless Operation**: Modified to run without graphics for faster execution
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed debugging logs for strategy analysis
- **Configurable Strategies**: Easy integration of new team strategies

## 🔧 Matrix Calculator

The `matrixCalculation.py` module is a critical component that generates customized parameters for optimal troop deployment in `hackstreetboys.py`. Here's how it works:

1. **Parameter Generation**: 
   - The module calculates counter factors between different troop types using a 12x12 matrix. Each entry in the matrix represents the effectiveness of one troop type against another.
   - Key parameters considered include troop number, health, damage, splash range, attack speed, and type.

2. **Counter Factor Calculation**:
   - For each pair of troops, the module calculates the time required for one troop to kill the other, considering splash damage and attack range.
   - Adjustments are made based on which troop starts attacking first, depending on their attack ranges.

3. **Strategic Analysis**:
   - The module analyzes the counter matrix to determine the best and worst counters for each troop type.
   - Detailed logs are generated in `counter_debug.log`, providing insights into the calculations and strategic recommendations.

## 🎯 Strategy Implementation in HackStreetBoys.py

The `HackStreetBoys.py` file implements the strategy logic for troop deployment. Here's a general overview:

1. **Troop Deployment**:
   - Utilizes the counter factors generated by `matrixCalculation.py` to determine optimal troop deployment strategies.
   - Adjusts troop formations and strategies based on the calculated effectiveness against enemy troops.

2. **Dynamic Strategy Adjustment**:
   - Continuously evaluates the battlefield conditions and adjusts strategies in real-time to maximize effectiveness.

3. **Integration with Game Engine**:
   - Works seamlessly with the game engine to execute strategies without graphical interfaces, focusing on performance and efficiency.

This integration allows for efficient testing and refinement of strategies, leveraging the detailed analysis provided by the matrix calculator.


## 💻 Usage


**Run the simulator**:
```bash
python main.py
```

The simulator will run multiple batches of matches between the configured teams and provide results.
